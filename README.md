# Improving Model Accuracy with XGBoost and Advanced Techniques

This repository contains code and analysis related to my thesis titled **"Improving Model Accuracy and Transparency in Binary Classification: A Study on Benchmark Data"**. This research was part of my **Management Engineering (Business Intelligence and Analytics)** program at **Sapienza University**, where I graduated.

The notebook provided here specifically covers the **"Improving Accuracy"** part of the thesis, demonstrating advanced techniques and strategies to optimize model performance.

## Key Sections
1. **Default XGBoost Model**: Benchmark performance for comparison.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Bayesian optimization for enhanced results.
3. **Data Handling**:
   - Managing hidden missing values.
   - KNN imputation for better data quality.
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
4. **Addressing Dataset Imbalance**: Techniques to balance datasets for robust model training.
5. **Model Stacking**:
   - Combining XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
   - Tuning stacked models for better accuracy.
6. **Cross-Dataset Analysis**:
   - Evaluating models on Chinese and Pakistani research datasets.
   - Performance visualization.
